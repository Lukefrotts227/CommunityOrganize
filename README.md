## Inspiration
- Recently, in my town, we had an issue where government finical mismanagement caused taxes to rise for all residents 
- Residents took to certain platforms to complain, but these "Community" applications do not allow political discussion
- My application aims to allow users to share ideas for getting involved in local government 
- It is not limited to this as they may share anything on the platform 

## What it does
- It is meant to allow for members of a certain community to take action together
- It does not restrict political action encouraging users to get involved in local politics something other "neighborhood" applications do not offer 
- Uses AI to improve the readability of user entries

## How we built it
- Using Atlas Mongdb for the database
- Backend created in python with fastapi 
- Frontend created in react alongside the standard js, html, css
- Openai api integration using the text processing model davinci-3.5
- Used pymongo to intearact with the database in python

## Challenges we ran into
- I found myself in the planning stage of this app for quite long 
- Over complicated everything in the beginning 
- Struggled with getting the backend understand data sent from the frontend and vice versa 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- My second complete web app 
- Improvement on my past projects 
- Able to sort users into certain communities and display user-generated data 

## What we learned
- Became far more proficient in React, js, html and css 
- Became far more proficent in the use of MongoDB
- Learned Fastapi 
- Used Routing to have the application extend beyond a single page 
- Integrating openai models 
- Improved my UI design 
- Most importantly improved time management skills as I was able to come up with and complete the project in  a limited time frame

## What's next for Community Organizer
- Of course will expand the project to be more interactive and allow it to function similar to a social media application 
- But before that I will make some adjustments 
- Adding an SQL database as progressing further will result in a large amount of data that must be linked 
- Transitioning to Django as it would provide more effective tools to manage the backend of my application
- Make the UI more interactive and visually appealing
